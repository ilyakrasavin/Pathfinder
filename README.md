This educational project features interactive visualizations of well-known and widely used path-finding algorithms used on Graphs.
Applications of presented algorithms are widely spread in the areas such as: 
- Games
- Scheduling
- Assignment Problems
- Social Networks
- Recommendation Systems and Maps.

This project is fully implemented in C++11. The Graphics library used is SFML 2.5.1

# Building & Compiling (MacOS)

### 1. Install SFML via Homebrew

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
brew install sfml
```

By default, SFML will be installed in the following folder on your machine:

/usr/local/Cellar/sfml/

### 2. Compile and Run 

Indicate Include and Library paths to the compiler:
```
g++ -g -std=c++11 -o pathfinder.out  main-visual.cpp Application.cpp Graph.cpp GraphWeighted.cpp Algorithms/BFS.cpp Algorithms/DFS.cpp Algorithms/A-Star.cpp Algorithms/Djkstra.cpp -I /usr/local/Cellar/sfml/2.5.1_1/include -L /usr/local/Cellar/sfml/2.5.1_1/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```
Run the program:

```
./pathfinder.out
```
